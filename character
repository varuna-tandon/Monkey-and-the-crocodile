** Story **
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamoon (berry) tree,
 which was on the banks of a river,
 in the same forest there lived a croodile and his wife. One day the 
 croodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree.
 The kindhearted monkey offered him some fruits, as he loved them.
 as days passed they became very good friends.
